The Data Health Dashboard is intended for your data consumers and stakeholders, that want to get a summary of what is happening with the data in your organization.

The dashboard is based on the 6 pillars of data observability:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Accuracy" icon="bullseye-arrow">
    The level to which data represents the real-world scenario and confirms with a verifiable source.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistency" icon="code-compare">
    The degree to which data is the same across all instances of the data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Completeness" icon="ballot-check">
    Is the data sufficient to deliver meaningful inferences and decisions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Freshness" icon="stopwatch">
    Whether or not the data is updated according to the expected SLA
  </Card>
  <Card title="Uniqueness" icon="barcode-read">
    Whether or not each record only exists in the system once and there are no duplications
  </Card>
  <Card title="Validity" icon="puzzle">
    Whether the values are in the same data type / format / range as indicated by a predefined set of rules
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The purpose of is to give a high-level overview that doesn't require deep technical knowledge or going into specific test results.
the dashboard presents the data health in a simple way, by giving a health score, and using a color code to indicate if this score is healthy.
Filters are available at the top of the page, making it easy to see the data health in different contexts.

### How is the data health score calculated?

Each test you run in either dbt or Elementary is mapped to one of these pillars, and given a score.
The scoring method is very simple:
- If the test passes, the score is 100
- If the test is in `warn` status, the score is 50
- If the test is in `fail` status, the score is 0

The results are aggregated to give a health score for each pillar.
The total score is a weighted average of the 6 pillars, where the weight is configurable.
The thresholds for the color coding (green, yellow and red) are also configurable.

### Can I customize the quality dimension mapping of my tests?
Of course!
Each test you run, whether it's a generic or a custom test, can be mapped to one of the 6 quality dimensions.
The way to do so is to add `quality_dimension` to the test definition in your dbt project:

<CodeGroup>

```yml test
tests:
  - not_null:
    meta:
      quality_dimension: completeness
```

```yml test/model config block
{{ config(
    meta={
        "quality_dimension": "completeness",
    }
) }}
```

</CodeGroup>


## Next steps

- **Send a daily report** of the data health to your stakeholders
- **Compare the data health** of different domains
- **Set up alerts** for when the data health is below a certain threshold

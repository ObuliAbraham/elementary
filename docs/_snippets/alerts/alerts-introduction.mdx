Elementary can send alerts about:

- Failures and/or warnings of dbt tests
- Failures and/or warnings Elementary tests
- Model runs failures
- Source freshness failures

### Alert details

You can enrich your alerts by adding properties to tests and models in your **`.yml`** files. The supported attributes are: Time, status, owners, tags, subscribers, result, test description, sample of faulty rows, test query and test configuration. 

You can customize the content of the alert to contain more / less detail based on the recipient.


### Set alert subscribers

Alert subscribers are configured in code. 

If you want additional users besides the owner to be tagged on an alert, add them as subscribers.

- You can configure a single subscriber or a list (**`["@jessica.jones", "@joe.joseph"]`**).

<CodeGroup>

```yml model
models:
  - name: my_model_name
    meta:
      subscribers: "@jessica.jones"
```

```yml test
tests:
  - not_null:
    meta:
      subscribers: ["@jessica.jones", "@joe.joseph"]
```

```yml test/model config block
{{ config(
    meta={
        "subscribers": "@jessica.jones"
    }
) }}
```

```yml dbt_project.yml
models:
  path:
    subfolder:
      +meta:
        subscribers: "@jessica.jones"

tests:
  path:
    subfolder:
      +meta:
        subscribers: "@jessica.jones"
```

## Create Alert Rules

Elementary allows you to configure alert rules based on different conditions. You can configure test categories, destinations, filters and suppression. 

**Why are alert rules important?** 

Data is propagated and distributed, leading to numerous recipients needing notifications when issues arise. For example, many data teams split their data products across business domains, ensuring that only people within a specific domain receive alerts about data issues in their domain's datasets.

To achieve this, you can create distinct alert rules for each domain based on tags. For instance, you can send all data issues related to marketing tables to the marketing-data-ops channel by using the marketing tag.

Given that data teams monitor numerous tables with numerous tests, it's crucial to use these rules to filter alerts that truly matter and ensure they reach the relevant owners who can effectively handle them.

### Select Test Categories

Test categories lets you configure which types of tests you want to be alerted on: 

1. Automated tests 
    - Auto volume
    - Auto freshness 
    - Auto schema (coming soon)
2. Tests as code - tests that are configured in your dbt project (Elementary package, dbt tests, custom tests and generic tests) 
3. Or both

The Slack channel you choose when connecting your Slack workspace is automatically added as a default alert rule, that sends all the alerts to that channel without any filtering. To modify, deactivate or add more rules, simply navigate to the “Alert routing rules” page in the left menu.
